I wrote this down a few days ago, but it was not shared. I imagined a doctor who was able to make sea monkeys both conscious of his will, and able to start their life on land, and as long as they never went into the water, they would become fully functional land creatures. If they fell in the water, even once, there they would remain. The doctor intended for each one to become fully functional.
